title: About
---



As you can already tell, I was born on a Tuesday. While my parents didn't have any inkling about the origin of the name, it's actually a day named after Tyr and Mars, the gods of strength and action. That same bold spirit inspires my approach to brand-building, where I craft compelling stories and narratives to help clients and brands stand out and connect with their audience.

I have a wealth of experience across content creation and strategy and have worked as a writer/editor and content strategist for more than 15 years, deciding to go freelance in October 2024. 

I've spent time in both agency and client-side roles in a range of industries such as FMCG for [Unilever HQ London](/work/unilever), tech, and sports including stints in international organisations like [Tokyo 2020 Olympics](/work/tokyo-2020), [London 2012 Olympics (Cultural Olympiad)](/work/london-2012), and the prestigious sports event, [Volvo Ocean Race](/work/volvo-ocean-race) in Spain.

As a seasoned communications professional with experience in Asia and Europe, I help drive innovative and engaging content projects that boost brand visibility, engagement and ROI for B2B and B2C clients. 

I love working with multi-cultural and cross-functional teams. I have lived in Manila, Madrid, Barcelona, Alicante, London and Tokyo and speak Filipino, English, Spanish, French (intermediate) and some Japanese. For more info, please book a discovery call.
