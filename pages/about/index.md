title: About
---



I was born on a Tuesday. While my parents didn't have any inkling about the origin of the name, it's actually a day named after Tyr and Mars, the gods of strength and action. That same bold spirit inspires my approach to brand-building, where I craft compelling stories and narratives to help clients and brands stand out and connect with their audience.

I have a wealth of experience in content creation and strategy. I have worked as a writer/editor and content strategist for more than 15 years before deciding to go freelance in October 2024.

I've worked in both agency and client-side roles across diverse industries, including FMCG with Unilever HQ in London, tech, and sports. My experience spans international organizations like the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, London 2012 Olympics (Cultural Olympiad), and the Volvo Ocean Race in Spain, where I successfully navigated high-pressure, high-visibility challenges.

As a seasoned communications professional with experience in Asia and Europe, I help drive innovative and engaging content projects that boost brand visibility, engagement, and ROI for B2B and B2C clients.

I love working with multi-cultural and cross-functional teams. I have lived in Manila, Madrid, Barcelona, Alicante, London, and Tokyo and speak Filipino, English, Spanish, French (intermediate) and Japanese. For more info, please book a discovery call.
