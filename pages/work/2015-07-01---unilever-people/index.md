## Global People and Content Advisor

The war for talent is fierce, and hiring and retaining talented employees is essential to any company's success.

### LinkedIn 

My role as Global People and Content Advisor for Unilever was to **help strengthen the employer brand**. We empowered employees by encouraging them to share their own stories and success.

As the **editorial lead**, I **managed the whole content process** and helped create a calendar with editorial themes to support the employer brand strategy. **Coordinating with HR teams across the world** (North Asia, Middle East, Europe, North America etc.), I helped identify and tap employees and feature them as brand ambassadors.

**More than 100+ blog posts** have been produced on LinkedIn that fundamentally focus on the following themes: employees' career journey, work flexibility, working mothers, women in IT, graduate programme, career advice from top hires, as well as some of the company's important pillars such as sustainability and innovation. 

These stories were **shared on Unilever LinkedIn account** as well as on Unilever's global career site.

Sustainability was a common thread in people's stories, proving that this is deeply ingrained in the culture of the company. As Unilever positions itself as a leader in sustainable business, every employee, no matter in which role they are, is contributing to the sustainable ambition of the company.

**Here are some examples of employee blog posts::**

### Global Careers Site

The employer brand team also spearheaded the restructuring of the global careers site. Revamping the format of the site as well as providing fresh content was an important step for the integrated employer brand strategy.

The aim was to help potential candidates navigate the site easily, help them find what they are looking for, encourage them to apply for roles and make the application process seamless.

To make this vision a reality, our team had a core working group with the global web team, the IT team and two external agencies over a year. The global web team managed the agency for the technical build and our team managed the other agency for content production. 


Together with the Employer brand director, **I was the main contact person for the different parts of the project**. My main responsibility was to manage agency relationships and coordinate with different functions within Unilever to ensure that the content created had been approved by different communication teams and that the messaging was consistent with the overall employer brand proposition.
