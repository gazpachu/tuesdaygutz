## Global Senior Content Manager

As the Global Senior Content Manager, I led the content strategy for the global website, ensuring that it's aligned with the overall business objectives and that all content initiatives are focused on boosting brand awareness, engagement and sales growth for international markets. I managed an editorial calendar that centred on storytelling while also serving strategic goals and tailored to business priorities. Supported by our content strategy and in combination of the initiatives of the sales team, TableCheck evolved from just a Japanese tech-start up into a global tech player, empowering hospitality operators worldwide.
