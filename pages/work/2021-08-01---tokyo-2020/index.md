Top athletes around the globe have descended on Tokyo for the world's biggest sporting event - the Tokyo 2020 Games. Rescheduled for 2021, the Games have become a beacon of hope for people around the world during the pandemic.

Billions of people tuned into this global event and the website attracted more than 195.7m unique visitors.

As the Games have been delayed by a year - which is unprecedented in the history of the Olympics and Paralympics - we had an opportunity to produce more in-depth pieces and interview features across 55 sports (33 Olympic sports, 22 Paralympic sports).
