The Volvo Ocean Race is **the world's toughest sailing competition**, and is considered by most of the greatest sailors as their personal Mt. Everest. Running 45,000 nautical miles around the world for eight months and stopping over several Host Cities, it is an ultimate test of endurance for teams not only for sailors but even for people behind the scenes.

## Winning mentality - **an experience to remember!**

Many consider this as just as a sports event, but the values it perpetuates has a lot of parallels in running a business or even life. For one, it takes a village to put this race together (from logistical operations, marketing promotion, branding, race management) that's why only MENTALLY TOUGH people are called into the fold. The people who thrive in this environment are natural leaders who know how to be team players and can manouvre their way around highly stressful situations.

## Marketing - Host Cities

As the Content Marketing Strategist, I worked in partnership with the Host Cities' delivery partners to promote the race and the Race Villages. The Race Villages provide the public the opportunity to take part and experience the race first-hand in their city. Aside from being a vehicle for branding and commercial opportunities for both global and local sponsors, the Race Village works as a marketing platform which can help strengthen the brand of Volvo Ocean Race/Volvo whilst putting a spotlight on the city brand.

Host Cities are required to create a strategy on the following: city branding, digital platforms like web/mobile, brochures, commercial playbooks, social media editorial plan. **I oversee the marketing strategies created by the delivery partners** and work closely with them and their creative agencies to ensure that all produced content comply with our branding and editorial guidelines and are delivered on time.

The most exciting **part of my job was collaborating with multicultural teams** from Host Cities (Alicante, Lisbon, Cape Town Melbourne, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Itaja√≠, Lisbon, Cardiff, Gothenburg, the Hague), and working together to make this race a success.
