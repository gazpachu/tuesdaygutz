Brands can stand out from the crowd by telling authentic stories that resonate with their audience. I blend storytelling with data-driven insights to create compelling and engaging content that highlights the brand's purpose and in a deeper way, build a long-term narrative that keeps them top of mind with customers and drives results.


I specialise in the following areas: 
-  Content standards and guidelines development
-  Content management including strategy ideation and managing editorial calendars 
-  Writing web articles, blogs, playbooks aligned with SEO guidelines 
-  Editing and proofreading for accuracy and adherence to style guides 
-  Interviewing clients for feature stories
-  Social media content creation
-  Management of freelance writers 
  

Let's tell meaningful stories!
